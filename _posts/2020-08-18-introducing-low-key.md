Let me tell you about what happened on this one team.

Sp there's Gary, the lead dev, there's John, product dude, there's Ginny, mid-level dev, and there's this new dude who joined a month ago or so, and his name is Low-Key.

That team does code reviews and Gary reviews them all. He often asks for changes.
At some point Gary is sick and there's a problem. Low-Key reaches out to Gary and asks for merge rights because Ginny has found the fix and he wants to merge it in. Gary says yeah.
Low-Key merges all the pending pull requests. Gary yells at Low-Key.
This happens again. The third time this happens, Gary gets Low-Key fired. Gary also gets pissed and reviews the code less because now it doesn't look like what he likes.
And over the course of the next few months, team happiness seems to rise, as does merge speed, and defect creation rate goes down.
And no one could find Low-Key. Not on LinkedIn, not on Facebook, not on Google. Except for this one thread on Hackernews from ten years ago, that seemed like it was the same person... But who could tell really.
